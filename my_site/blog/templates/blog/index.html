                        There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the
                        mountains! And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I
                        was enjoying the view!

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
        I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new
        technologies in general!
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do
        the same, I'd be very happy!
